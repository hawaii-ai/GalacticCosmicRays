# GalacticCosmicRays
GCR forecasting project with Claudio Corti

/data
Datasets used in this project.
- BR2461.dat initial dataset.
- new_models.dat Dataset received Feb 2022.The order of the parameters in each line is the usual one: alpha, cmf, cpa, pwr1par, pwr2par, pwr1perr, pwr2perr. For alpha and cmf, I added new values (alpha = 0, 10, 85; cmf = 2.5, 3.5, 9.5), which reflect more extreme conditions in the heliosphere: lower values of alpha and cmf correspond to a more quiet heliosphere, which result in less modulation of cosmic rays (less difference in the rigidity spectrum with respect to the local interstellar spectrum, the boundary condition at the external edge of the heliosphere), while higher values of alpha and cmf correspond to a more turbulent heliosphere, which result in more modulation.
